# Build a Collection with MongoDB and mongoose

Pick an item either you collect or that you have heard of people collecting. Build a Mongoose schema for this item. Your schema must have:

At least one non-string field
An array
At least one nested object (can be in array)

Using your schema, build an Express app that lets you view your collection, add to your collection, edit items in your collection, and delete items from your collection.
